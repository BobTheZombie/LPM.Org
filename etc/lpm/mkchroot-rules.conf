# mkchroot-rules.conf -- default bootstrap rules for lpm
#
# The file uses simple KEY=value directives. Values are parsed with shell-like
# quoting, so whitespace separates entries and quotes/escapes are honored.
#
# base   : packages that are always requested for a new chroot. The defaults
#          ensure a minimal userland and package manager support.
# include: additional packages that should be installed unless explicitly
#          overridden on the command line.
# build  : lpmbuild script specs that should be built when ``lpm bootstrap`` is
#          invoked with ``--build``. Entries can reference local paths or
#          repository locations resolvable by the bootstrap helper.
#
# Adjust the values below to match the packages provided by your repositories.
# The baseline is intentionally conservative and can serve as a starting point
# for custom chroot definitions.
